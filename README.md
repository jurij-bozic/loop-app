# LoopApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Before running Dev server

Since the `node_modules` file is not inclued in the repository, first run `npm i` and only after that `ng serve`.

## Angular packages

The following Angular packages may need to be installed in order to run the app: `ng add @angular/material`, `ng add @angular/forms`.

## Browser support
The app has been tested in current versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. While the app works fine in Chrome and Firefox, the user-search functionality needs some debugging in **Safari**.
